/**
 * Polling that stops.
 *
 * htmx polls with `hx-trigger="every 2s"`, and the usual way to stop is for the
 * server to return a fragment without the trigger once the work reaches a
 * terminal state. That works right up until the work *never* reaches one —
 * the process is killed mid-run, the row stays `running` for ever, and the page
 * asks again every two seconds, indefinitely, for every viewer. Nothing about
 * the polling itself makes that visible.
 *
 * The fix here is a bound the server controls. There is no client state to hold
 * it in and no client state wanted, so the counter rides in the polled URL: each
 * response asks for the next attempt, and when the count runs out the server
 * stops emitting a trigger and says so instead.
 *
 * Two things follow from the bound being declared rather than implied:
 *
 *   - `unbounded-poll` in `rules.ts` can tell a bounded poll from an unbounded
 *     one, because a bounded one carries `data-poll-max`;
 *   - "how long will this poll for, at worst" has an answer you can read off
 *     the markup, without tracing the terminal states of a state machine.
