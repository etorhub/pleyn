/**
 * The documentation sections that come out of the code.
 *
 * `AGENTS.md` is not courtesy documentation: it is the manual whoever touches
 * this code reads — person or agent — and trusts. When a part of it falls
 * behind, it is not untidy, it is lying, and somebody is working on top of it.
 *
 * A list of out-of-band targets written by hand beside the code drifts away
 * from it within a dozen commits, every time. The only way it cannot is for it
 * not to be written by hand.
 *
 * So these sections **are generated**:
 *
 *   bun run docs         rewrites them
 *   bun run docs:check   fails when they no longer match (inside `bun run check`)
 *
 * Each section lives between two HTML markers. What is outside them is never
 * touched: the documents stay written by people, and only these pieces come
 * out of the code.
 *
 * Adding one means adding an entry to `SECTIONS`.
