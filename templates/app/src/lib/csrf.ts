/**
 * CSRF.
 *
 * `SameSite=Lax` on the session cookie is not a defence on its own. It stops
 * the easy case, but it lets top-level GET navigations through, and a form
 * submitted from another tab travels with the cookie whenever the browser
 * counts the submission as a navigation. With htmx, on top of that, every
 * mutation is a background request.
 *
 * The token is `HMAC-SHA256(SECRET_KEY, session_token_digest)`:
 *
 *   - no table and no server state are needed;
 *   - it is tied to the session, so it rotates when the session does and dies
 *     with it;
 *   - whoever lacks the cookie cannot compute it, and whoever has it is
 *     already the user.
 *
 * It is published **once**, as the `<body>`'s `hx-headers`, and every htmx
 * request inherits it. Never one per form.
